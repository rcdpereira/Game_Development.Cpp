# Game Development with C++

This repository will be used to share the work developed in the new course I'm taking: [Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/).

The course is offered by the [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) team, and is held at Udemy.

Enjoy the content and few free to add your comments if you see something that can be improved.
